Multiple concepts of MLOps including :
- tracking and monitoring ML models with **mlflow**
- tests with **pytest**
- CI/CD pipeline with **github actions**

## Introduction
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a discipline that combines the development of machine learning (ML) models and the practices of deploying and managing these models in production environments.  
Inspired by DevOps principles, MLOps aims to automate and improve the entire lifecycle of ML models, from design to deployment, monitoring and ongoing maintenance to production.

## Tracking and monitoring ML models
This section is dedicated to track experiments and monitor ML models with MLflow.

MLflow is an open-source platform, purpose-built to assist machine learning practitioners and teams in handling the complexities of the machine learning process.  
MLflow focuses on the full lifecycle for machine learning projects, ensuring that each phase is manageable, traceable, and reproducible.

## Tests
This section is dedicated to mutiple tests applied during the development of ML models.

## CI/CD Pipeline
This section is dedicated to the auto pipeline for continuous developement CI/CD.
